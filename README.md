# 🎯 Ad Bidding A/B Test

This is a fun and realistic A/B testing project where I analyze how two different ad bidding strategies—manual vs automated—perform across core marketing KPIs.

It's designed to reflect the kind of work a data analyst might do at a performance-driven company.

---

## 🧪 What’s the Goal?

We want to see which bidding strategy works better based on:

- 📈 CTR: Click-Through Rate
- ✅ CVR: Conversion Rate
- 💸 ROAS: Return on Ad Spend
- 🧮 CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost

---

## 🛠️ What Did I Use?

- **Python** – for data analysis, visualizations, and A/B test checks.
- **SQL (MySQL)** – to crunch campaign metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – to walk through the whole analysis.
- **MySQL Workbench** – for SQL queries and KPIs.

## 🔍 Insights I Found

- ROAS and CAC were **pretty close** between the two groups.
- The **test group (automated bidding)** had more variability in conversions, but peaked early.
- **Manual bidding** had a few standout campaigns (best ROAS), but overall the results were mixed.
- This suggests that a **hybrid approach** might be worth exploring.

## 🧠 Example SQL Query I Ran

```sql
SELECT
  group_type,
  ROUND(SUM(clicks) / SUM(impressions), 4) AS CTR,
  ROUND(SUM(conversions) / SUM(clicks), 4) AS CVR,
  ROUND(SUM(revenue_eur) / SUM(spend_eur), 2) AS ROAS,
  ROUND(SUM(spend_eur) / SUM(conversions), 2) AS CAC
FROM ad_data
GROUP BY group_type;
```

## 🧠 Final Takeaways

This A/B test compared **manual vs automated ad bidding** strategies across several key marketing KPIs. Here's what we learned:

- 📈 **CTR & CVR**: Both groups performed similarly on click-through and conversion rates, indicating neither strategy had a clear edge in driving clicks or converting them.

- 💸 **ROAS & CAC**:
  - On average, **manual bidding** delivered slightly better ROAS and lower CAC.
  - However, **automated bidding** showed **higher variability**, suggesting it can perform very well in some campaigns — but isn’t always consistent.

- 🔍 **Top-performing campaigns** were mostly found in the **manual group**, reinforcing the idea that manual control may be better optimized in certain cases.

- 📆 **Daily trends** showed that automated bidding sometimes spikes in performance early on, but then stabilizes, possibly due to its learning phase or budget pacing.

### ✅ Overall Conclusion:

If consistency and control are important, **manual bidding** may be the safer bet. But if the goal is to scale fast and test more aggressively, **automated bidding** has potential — especially with proper monitoring and thresholds.

A **hybrid strategy** might be best: start automated for scale, then switch high-potential campaigns to manual for fine-tuning.
